# i2b2 2009 to CoNLL text parser

Code parsing i2b2 2009 clinical text data to the well-known CoNLL format for use with https://github.com/mxhofer/Named-Entity-Recognition-BidirectionalLSTM-CNN-CoNLL. 

Note these limitations of the parser:
1) Annotations across line breaks are not considered (losing 71 out of 23,991 total annotations)
2) Chunk tagger only tags noun phrases (NP) and verb phrases (VP)Â 
3) BIO annotation scheme is implemented with the tag "B-XXX" at the start of each sequence of type XXX (instead of only to differentiate consecutive tags of type XXX)
